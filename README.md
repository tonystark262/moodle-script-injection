# Moodle Script Injection
This project was born out of cuorsity to learn javascript and also to minimize the amount of time it takes to login to the [IITD moodle](https://moodle.iitd.ac.in/login/index.php).
The javascript will automatically solve the captcha and write the answer in the text box.

## Usage
This is not a standalone installer, so need to have a javascript injector extension. Just past the code in the injector and you are good to go.

SO, GO AHEAD THE MAKE THE LIFE SIMPLE!!!
